# ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Setup and Test Execution with Allure

This guide will walk you through setting up the necessary environment, installing dependencies, running tests, generating an Allure report, and opening the report.

## Prerequisites

- **Java**: Version 21
- **Maven**: Version 3.9.5
- **Allure**: For generating and viewing test reports

## 1. Install Java

### On macOS/Linux:
To install Java, we recommend using **SDKMAN** (or **Homebrew** on macOS). 

#### Install SDKMAN (macOS/Linux):

```sh
curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"
```

Then install Java (e.g., OpenJDK 11):

```sh
sdk install java 21.0.3-tem
```

Verify the installation:

```sh
java -version
```

### On Windows:
Download Java from the [official website](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) and follow the installation instructions.

After installation, add the `bin` directory of the Java JDK to your system's `PATH` environment variable.

## 2. Install Maven

### On macOS/Linux:

#### Install using Homebrew (macOS):

```sh
brew install maven
```

#### Install using SDKMAN (Linux):

```sh
sdk install maven
```

Verify the installation:

```sh
mvn -v
```

### On Windows:
Download Maven from the [official website](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) and follow the installation instructions. Make sure to add Maven's `bin` directory to your system's `PATH`.

## 3. Install Allure Command-Line Tool

### On macOS/Linux:
Install Allure using Homebrew:

```sh
brew install allure
```

Alternatively, on Linux, you can download the Allure command-line tool from the [Allure releases page](https://github.com/allure-framework/allure2/releases) and extract it to a directory in your `PATH`.

To verify the installation:

```sh
allure --version
```

### On Windows:
Download Allure from the [Allure releases page](https://github.com/allure-framework/allure2/releases) and follow the instructions for setting up Allure on Windows. Add the `bin` folder to your system `PATH`.

## 4. Install Project Dependencies Without Running Tests

Once you have Java and Maven set up, navigate to your project directory and run:

```sh
mvn install -DskipTests
```

This command will download all the required dependencies and install them without running the tests.

## 5. Run the Tests

To run your tests with Maven, use:

```sh
mvn test
```

This will execute the tests in your project.

## 6. Generate the Allure Report

After running your tests, you can generate the Allure report by running:

```sh
allure generate allure-results -o allure-report --clean
```

This will generate the Allure report in the `allure-results` directory.

An alternative is to generate a single file format, which results in an html file and does not depend on allure to open - just open the file itself is enough
```sh
allure generate allure-results -o allure-report --clean --single-file
```

## 7. Open the Allure Report

Once the report is generated, you can open it using the following command:

```sh
allure open allure-report
```

This will automatically start a web server and open the Allure report in your default browser.

Alternatively, you can manually open the report by navigating to the `target/site/allure-maven-plugin` folder in your project and opening the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Troubleshooting

- **Java not found**: Ensure that Java is correctly installed and the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is set.
- **Maven not found**: Ensure that Maven is correctly installed and the `MAVEN_HOME` environment variable is set.
- **Allure not found**: Ensure that Allure is installed and available in your `PATH`.
